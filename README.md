# Photo Watermark Utility - FOSS, 100% client-side JS
Simply scratching my own itch -- it works for my intended use-case.  Feel free to submit PR if you want to add functionality, or just fork it and make it do whatever you want.

## Example Usage

### License
Looks like ExifReader is licensed under 'Mozilla Public License 2.0'.  I glanced at it, seems relatively permissive.  There's very little originality in the code I wrote here, so do with my code as you please.  

Obviously, you must still adhere to [ExifReader's license](https://github.com/mattiasw/ExifReader/blob/main/LICENSE) -- but feel free to fork/alter/edit *my* code to your heart's content!  =)
